     * In the first part, the method checks, if the given param is 8.
     * If it is, the program jumps to the void method drawBoard in line 72
     * and leaves the method that is in place by returning true.
     * <p>
     * In the second part, a for loop is run through.
     * For every iteration, the index of the drawBoardArr gets the value of the counting variable i assigned.
     * After that, the boolean method drawBoardArr with the params drawBoardArr and index is called.
     * If the called boolean method returns true, the for loop jumps to the next iteration.
     * If the called boolean method returns false, the method in place calls itself
     * with an incremented index.
     * @param drawBoardArr the referenced array from the main method.
     * @param index this variable is essential for the loop in the method. It is responsible for how often the method is run.
     * @return false as long as index is not 8, true if index is 8.
